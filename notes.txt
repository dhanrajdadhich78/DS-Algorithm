Merge Sort O(n lg(n))
Merge sort does have a couple of disadvantages compared with the
other two sorting algorithms we have seen. First, the constant factor
that we hide in the asymptotic notation is higher than for the other two
algorithms. Of course, once the array size n gets large enough, that
doesnâ€™t really matter. Second, merge sort does not work in place: it has
to make complete copies of the entire input array.
